# grouprepcode
This repo contains Python adaptations of the latent group model. The first file contains a function that takes in a matrix of discrete choices (rows of agents by columns of choices) as input and outputs the probabilities of possible partitions. The second file contains a function that will output the marginal posterior probabilities for pairs of agents.
