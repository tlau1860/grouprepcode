This repo contains Python adaptations of the latent group model (as discussed in [Lau, 2021](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2020.0136)). The first file contains a function that takes in a matrix of discrete choices (rows of agents by columns of choices) as input and outputs the probabilities of possible partitions. The second file contains a function that will output the marginal posterior probabilities for pairs of agents.
